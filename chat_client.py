chatclient:
On startup, each client will connect to the server and sends its id provided by the user. The server
will register this client. Each client is required to send an alive message to the server after regular
intervals so that the server is updated about its presence. The server will tell to the client about
the length of this interval in response to the connect message. If the server doesnâ€™t receive an
alive message from some client then it de-lists it and sends the latest list to all online clients.
Whenever a client wants to send a message, it sends a message to the server with the target
clientid. Clients can also request the latest client list by sending a message to server.
